# Task 8: Clustering with K-Means

## 📌 Objective
Perform unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify patterns and group similar data points.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PCA (for dimensionality reduction)

## 🔍 Task Overview
This task demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering on a dataset, including key steps such as:

1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
2. Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm.
3. Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Visualizing clusters using PCA for 2D representation.
5. Evaluating cluster quality using the Silhouette Score.

## 📊 Highlights
- Optimal number of clusters identified using both Elbow Method and Silhouette Score analysis.
- Best silhouette score of **0.44** achieved with **6 or 7 clusters**, indicating reasonably well-defined clusters.
- Interactive visualizations included to interpret clustering output.

## 📁 Files Included
- `K-Means clustering.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full implementation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.
3. Install required libraries if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
